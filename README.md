##  Guide to Use App
    When you click to add quote, you can add a quote through a form that will ask you:
    -the author
    -the name of publisher
    -and the quote

    If you enter anything the button create now can not work. 
    If you fill everything you can create your quote

    When you click on Home you back to home page when you can see all quotations.

    When you click on read more you can focus on that quotation that you have clicked on.
    You can also delete the quote with the red button button delete
    You can also see when they posted a quote.
##  BDD
    - Your Project should be created using the Angular CLI.
    - Your project should contain a custom model class for the quote
    - Your project should have a custom directive to highlight the quote that has the highest upvotes.
    - Your project should contain a form component that has input sections for the quote, the author, and the person who submitted the quote.
    - Each quote must begin with an initial upvote and downvote value of 0
    - Your project should have a component to display the quote and a component to display quote details. For example, the quote details could have the author of the quote and the votes it has.
    - Your project should contain a custom pipe that shows how much time has passed since the quote was created.
